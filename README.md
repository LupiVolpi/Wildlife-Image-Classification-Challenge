# Wildlife-Image-Classification-Challenge

# Description:
Welcome to the Wildlife Image Classification Challenge repository! This project focuses on developing an accurate and efficient model for classifying wildlife images. Through extensive experimentation with various neural network formats and architectures, we have achieved an impressive accuracy of 87.56% using the powerful pre-trained ResNet-50 model.

This repository contains the code and resources used to train and evaluate our image classification model. The approach includes data preprocessing, model implementation, and fine-tuning techniques. 

This project was developed during the first semester of 2023 as part of the final project for Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp.

# Key Features:
- High Accuracy: The best model achieves an accuracy of 87.56% on the Wildlife Image Classification Challenge dataset, showcasing its robust performance.
- ResNet-50 Model: The best model uses the popular and powerful ResNet-50 model as the backbone for image classification tasks, benefiting from its deep convolutional layers.
- Experimentation: Various neural network formats were explored and compared, yielding insights into their performance and suitability for wildlife image classification.
